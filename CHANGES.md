## Overview
Restored 9-28 archive version as the main codebase and implemented comprehensive improvements to both SoliTone and 53 Card Pickup games.

---

## SoliTone Improvements

### HUD Layout Redesign
- **Compact 6-column grid layout** with centered controls
- **Column 1**: Title
- **Column 2**: 2x2 waveform selector buttons (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades)
- **Column 3**: Listen To button, Tuning dropdown, Fundamental slider with harmony button
- **Column 4**: BPM slider, Note Division display, Swing control
- **Column 5**: Music toggle, new Delay button
- **Column 6**: Reset and Quit buttons
- All controls now have fixed sizing to prevent layout shifts

### New Features
- **Fundamental Harmony Button** (ðŸŽµ): When enabled, plays fundamental tone with major/minor harmonics on accented notes
- **Delay Effect**: Toggle delay with feedback (purple button in column 5)
- **Responsive Background**: Gradient now subtly cycles while controls shift the spectrum endpoints
- **Enhanced Card Highlighting**: Playing cards now have yellow glow instead of white for better visibility

### Improved Accent Display
- **Stacking system**: Up to 4 lines of accent text can display simultaneously
- **Auto-fade**: Each line stays visible for 1 second before fading
- **Oldest-first removal**: When >4 lines, oldest fades faster to make room
- Text positioned top-left with better visibility (yellow with shadow)

### Victory State Fix
- Ensured audio context stays active for victory scale playback
- Stop music command no longer prevents victory tones from playing

### Spacing & Layout
- Reduced gap between HUD and play area by 50% (32px â†’ 16px)
- More compact overall layout fits better on screen

## 53 Card Pickup Improvements

### Autoplay Fix
- **Audio context initialization**: Now properly initializes on user click to bypass browser restrictions
- **Context resume**: Automatically resumes suspended audio contexts
- Music starts reliably after card drop animation

### Control Button Improvements
- **Fixed sizing**: All buttons now have `min-width` to prevent shrinking/movement
- **Visual feedback**: All buttons flash brighter color on click
- **Consistent spacing**: 140-160px min-width keeps layout stable

### New Features
- **Stack Cards Button**: Gathers all cards into a face-down deck at center
- **Working Swing Button**: Toggle rhythmic variations (yellow when on)
- **Shift Key Shortcut**: Hold Shift to sustain notes (indicated by â‡§ symbol)
- **Z-Index Management**: Dragged cards automatically come to top of stack

### Button List (Bottom Controls)
1. All Face Up (blue)
2. All Face Down (orange)
3. Stack Cards (blue-purple) - NEW
4. Delay: Off/On (purple)
5. Sustain â‡§ (pink) - Now with shift key support
6. Swing: Off/On (yellow) - NOW WORKING
7. Random Durations (green)
8. Random Rests (yellow)

### Drag Performance
- Cards use proper z-index tracking
- `highestZIndex` counter ensures moved cards are always on top
- Smoother initial drag response

## Latest Updates (October 4, 2025 - Final Polish)

### SoliTone HUD Refinements
- **Perfect alignment**: Listen button now aligns with 2x2 waveform grid top
- **Tuning dropdown**: Bottom edge aligns with 2x2 grid bottom
- **Reorganized columns**: Fundamental controls moved to Column 4 under BPM
- **BPM slider positioning**: Top aligns with Listen button height
- **BPM readout repositioned**: Now inline with BPM label, editable text input
- **Swing moved**: Now under Delay button in Column 5, shows "Swing On/Off"

- **Delay button**: White text for better visibility

- **Visual click feedback**: All buttons flash brighter on click

### Technical Improvements
- **Fundamental frequency locking**: Can toggle between Hz and musical notes with proper conversion
